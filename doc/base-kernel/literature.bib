  Abstract                 = {User applications and data in volatile memory are usually lost when an operating system crashes because of errors caused by either hardware or software faults. This is because most operating systems are designed to stop working when some internal errors are detected despite the possibility that user data and applications might still be intact and recoverable. Techniques like exception handling, code reloading, operating system component isolation, micro-rebooting, automatic system service restarts, watchdog timer based recovery and transactional components can be applied to attempt self-healing of an operating system from a wide variety of errors. Fault injection experiments show that these techniques can be used to continue running user applications after transparently recovering the operating system in a large percentage of cases. In cases where transparent recovery is not possible, individual process recovery can be attempted as a last resort.},

/** pseudo-FIFO queue with delegation support, that is the first

 * responsible to process the enties that were pushed later. The pop()
 * operation swaps the queue tails and returns the newest entry from
 * the internal queue first.
 *
 * inspired by: OyamaTauraYonezawa1999 
 * "Executing parallel programs with synchronization bottlenecks efficiently"
 * but the producer/delegator uses exchange instead of CAS
 * and the consumer/owner may have to wait.
 *
 * TaskletBase::nextTasklet points to the next older message. tail
 * points to the newest entry of the queue. head is not the head of
 * the same queue. Instead it points to the next item to pop from queue.

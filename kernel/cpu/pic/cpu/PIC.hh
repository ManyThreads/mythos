/** Disable the 8259 PIC properly. 
 *
 * (From http://wiki.osdev.org/APIC)
 * This is nearly as important as setting up the APIC. You do this
 * in two steps: masking all interrupts and remapping the
 * IRQs. Masking all interrupts disables them in the
 * PIC. Remapping is what you probably already did when you used
 * the PIC: you want interrupt requests to start at 32 instead of
 * 0 to avoid conflicts with the exceptions. This is necessary
 * because even though you masked all interrupts on the PIC, it
 * could still give out spurious interrupts which will then be
 * misinterpreted from your kernel as exceptions.

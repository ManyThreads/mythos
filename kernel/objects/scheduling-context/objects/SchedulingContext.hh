  /** Scheduler for multiple application threads on a single hardware
   * thread. It implements an cooperative FIFO strategy that switches only
   * when the currently selected application thread becomes blocked.
   *
   * The scheduler has a queueable handle pointing to the currently
   * selected Execution Context and a FIFO queue of waiting ECs.
   *
   * If a new EC becomes ready and there is no selected EC, the new
   * one is selected and a wakeup message is sent to the hardware
   * thread. Otherwise, the newly ready EC is appended to the
   * queue. The implementation takes care of ECs that are enqueued
   * already.
   *
   * If an EC preempted and it is the selected EC, a preemptive message
   * is sent to the hardware thread in order to suspend the EC's
   * execution. If the EC is still ready (executable), it is appended
   * to the waiting queue if it is not empty or it stays the selected
   * EC if there is no other waiting. Preempting other ECs then the
   * selected one does nothing because their readiness is checked when
   * selecting them for execution later. Their ready state may change
   * multiple times without the need to update the queue.
   *
   * In order to yield execution to the next waiting EC, the selected
   * EC can preempt itself while staying ready.
   *
   * The hardware thread's main routine asks the scheduler to switch
   * to user mode. Then the currently selected EC is resumed if
   * present. This may fail because the EC is no longer ready. In that
   * case, the next EC is selected from the queue and resumed. This
   * repeats until one of the waiting ECs is actually ready or the
   * queue is empty. If no ready EC was found, there is no selected EC
   * and the control returns.
